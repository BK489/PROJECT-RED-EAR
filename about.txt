RED-EAR is an educational tool created by Beck (BK489).
The software allows users to download all videos from a YouTube channel in audio format.
It also generates a configuration file that enables automatic updates to the directory on subsequent runs.

This project serves as a portfolio piece and demonstrates best practices in software development,
including proper version control, documentation, and deployment.

While downloading YouTube videos for personal use is not inherently illegal,
redistribution or usage of the downloads for non-personal or non-educational purposes may be subject 
to legal restrictions. Users are advised to seek permission from the content owner for any commercial use.

For more information regarding legal considerations, please refer to the project's license.

---The responsibility for the usage of this software lies entirely with the user---
